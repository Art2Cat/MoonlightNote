        California Online Privacy Protection Act\n\n

        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
        services to post a privacy policy. The law\'s reach stretches well beyond California to
        require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
        operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
        http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\n\n

        According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n
        Users can visit our site anonymously.\n
        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a
        minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.\n
        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word \'Privacy\' and can easily be found on the page
        specified above.\n\n

        It\'s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking\n\n

        COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\n

        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13
        years old, the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
        The Federal Trade Commission, United States\' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
        Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
        children\'s privacy and safety online.\n\n

        We do not collect information from children under 13\n\n
        children under 13.\n
        No\n\n

        In order to remove your child\'s information please contact the following personnel:\n

        We adhere to the following COPPA tenants:\n
        • Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child\'s information is
        shared through contacting us directly or contacting us directly.\n\n

        Fair Information Practices\n\n

        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
        United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
        development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
        Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the
        various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\n

        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
        responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n
        We will notify you via email\n
        • Within 7 business days\n\n

        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
        the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who
        fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
        rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
        agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\n

        CAN SPAM Act\n\n

        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
        for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent
        to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\n

        We collect your email address in order to:\n
        • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions\n\n

        To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:\n

        If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
        and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.\n\n
